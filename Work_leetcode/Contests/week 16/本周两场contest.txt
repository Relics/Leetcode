Hi everyone! @stefanpochmann @stomach_ache @fallcreek

After considering the voting data coming from users, we decided to change the time of *10:30am* PST contest to *07:30am* PST.

And for this week we have *two contests*:
------------------------------------------------------
The *week 16 contestA* (This week) Saturday (*2017.01.21*) *07:30am* PST contestâ€™s problems are:
Problem 1-*Find Permutation* (Greedy): https://leetcode.com/library/edit/521/
Problem 2-*Increasing Subsequences* (construct): https://leetcode.com/library/edit/522/
Problem 3-*Target Sum* (DP / DFS): https://leetcode.com/library/edit/518/

------------------------------------------------------
The *week 16 contestB* (This week) Saturday (*2017.01.21*) *18:30pm* PST contest's problems are:
