You can save <b>the Little Match Girl</b>! In the street corner, at the cold hour of dawn, sat a poor girl, with rosy cheeks and with a smiling mouth, leaning against the wall--frozen to death on the last evening of the old year. Stiff and stark sat the child there with her matches, of which one bundle had been burnt. "She just wanted to use her matchsticks to form a square, maybe this is her only hope." people said.
</p>
<p>By now, you know exactly what matchsticks the little match girl has, please find out a way you can make one square by using up all those matchsticks. You should not break any stick, but you can link them up, and each matchstick must be used <b>exactly</b> one time. Only in this way, the little match girl will be happy, and will be alive again!</P>

<p> Your input will be several matchsticks the girl has, represented with their stick length. Your output will either be true or false, to represent whether you can save this little girl or not.</p>

<p><b>Example 1:</b><br />
<pre>
<b>Input:</b> [1,1,2,2,2]
<b>Output:</b> true

<b>Explanation:</b> You can form a square with length 2, one side of the square came two sticks with length 1.

<p><b>Example 2:</b><br />
<pre>

<b>Output:</b> false

<b>Explanation:</b> You cannot find a way to form a square with all the matchsticks and you cannot save this little girl.
