Hi everyone, 

Today's contest we make a history - we have over 1000 users submit their solutions.

But during the contest process, we encountered some problems which make some users get CE. This problem could be solved by publishing again before the contest. It's my fault and I will try to avoid this kind of problem in the future.

I'm reflecting on my faults. Here are some tips I want to share with you, it's concluded by me. I hope it will be useful for you.

*Something must let other people know, tell other people in the contest channel*:
1. Change of un-default function name.
2. Change of the boundary/size of the test cases.
3. Change of the problem name.

*Problem Review Process*:
0. Check whether this problem has existed.
1. Check whether the problem description is accurate/incomplete.
2. Check whether the problem test set is complete or not; If it is not complete, please complete it.
3. Check the problem description spelling and the set function name is right/suitable or not.
4. Set/Check the boundary of the test cases.
5. After you AC this problem, please check some solutions that should get *TLE* (like n^2), if other people haven't checked it yet.

*Final CheckList (Mainly My responsibility)*:
0. Final-Check the set boundary of test cases.
1. Fianl-Check the problem description and function name is right or not.
2. Final Publish all the questions.
