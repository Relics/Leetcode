<p>Given an array of character, compress it in-place.</p>

<p>The length after compression must always be smaller than or equal to the original array.</p>

<p>You should not allocate any extra space, you must modify the input array in-place and return the new length of the array.</p>

<p><b>Example 0:</b><br />
<pre>
Input:
['a']

Output:
Return 1, and the first 1 characters of the input array should be: ['a']

Explanation:
Nothing is replaced.
</pre>
</p>

<p><b>Example 1:</b><br />
<pre>
Input:
['a','a','b','b','c','c','c']

Output:
Return 5, and the first 5 characters of the input array should be: ['a','2','b','2','c','3']

Explanation:
"aa" is replaced by "a2". "bb" is replaced by "b2". "ccc" is replaced by "c3".
</pre>
</p>

<p><b>Example 2:</b><br />
<pre>
Input:
['a','b','b','b']

Output:
Return 3, and the first 3 characters of the input array should be: ['a','b','3']

Explanation:
Since the character 'a' does not repeat, it is not compressed. "bbb" is replaced by "b3".
